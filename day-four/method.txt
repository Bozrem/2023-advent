Part 1 Problem:
We have a few scratchoff tickets, with winning numbers and our numbers
The points given in each scratchoff is (number won)^2

Part 1 Initial Solution:
Go line by line
Regex to get a list of winning numbers, and a list of our numbers
if winning.contains(ours[i]) won++
total += (won)^2

Part 1 Revised Solution:
Go line by line
Regex to get a list of winning numbers, and a list of our numbers
Make our numbers a set for more efficient searching
Count wins
total += truncated(2 ^ (won - 1))

Part 2 Problem:
The amount of wins from a ticket just wins you more of the tickets after. So winning 3 on ticket 5 gives me a copy of tickets 6, 7, and 8
How many scratchoffs do we get?

Part 2 Initial Solution:
Make a 'multiplier' set
After getting wins for a ticket:
    Add 1 + multiplier(its number) to ticketCounter
    For(thisTicket to thisTicket+n):
        Multiplier of that one += multiplier(thisTicket) + 1

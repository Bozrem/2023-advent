Part 1 Problem:
There is a missing part in an engine
We have the schematics, and each part that is adjacent to a symbol counts as a part
if we add all the part numbers, we should be able to figure out what the missing part is
Add all "parts" defined by numbers adjacent to a symbol


Initial Part 1 Solution:
Part class:
    bool isValid
    int numbers
    Coordinates of it's edges
    Function checkValidity(input[][]){
        Checks all characters around the numbers Coordinates for a symbol, true if one found, false otherwise
    }
Parse the input into a massive double string array (String[][])
in each line, go character by character to find digits
When a digit is found, make a new Part, and move along the double string array to get its corner Coordinates
Add all parts to a parts list
For each part, add its numbers to a sum if checkValidity()

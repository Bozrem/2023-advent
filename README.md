# 2023 Advent of Code
This year, to get myself to explore more languages, I will do each day in a random language from the following list:
* Rust
* Go
* C#
* JavaScript
* Kotlin
* C++
* Ruby
* Java
* C
* Swift
* Haskell
* Python

Each day will be seperated into it's own folder, and should have a method.txt file to describe my plan of attack

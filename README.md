# 2023 Advent of Code
### Overview
This year, to get myself to explore more languages, I will do each day in a random language from the following list:
* Rust
* Go
* C#
* JavaScript
* Kotlin
* C++
* Ruby
* Java
* C
* Swift
* Haskell
* Python

### Project Structure
Each day will be seperated into it's own folder, containing all relavent files like code, input text, and method. </br>
The Method.txt in each day will detail:
* Selected language of the day
* Part x problem
* Part x initial solution
* Part x revised solution after completion
* Part x answer

I will try my best to keep the code clean and have both Part 1 and 2 functionality. Cut me some slack on a few of these, as I'm new to some of the languages and their conventions.
